# üöÄ GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## **Your Application is Now Ready for GitHub Pages!**

The Utah Government Contracting Hub has been successfully built and configured for GitHub Pages deployment. Here's what you need to do to make it live:

## üìã **Step-by-Step Setup Instructions**

### **1. Enable GitHub Pages in Your Repository**

1. **Go to your repository**: [https://github.com/ShayneIsMagic/APEX_GOEO_UTAH](https://github.com/ShayneIsMagic/APEX_GOEO_UTAH)

2. **Navigate to Settings**:
   - Click on the "Settings" tab in your repository
   - Scroll down to the "Pages" section in the left sidebar

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**:
   - **Source**: Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch**: Select "gh-pages" (this will be created automatically)
   - **Folder**: Select "/ (root)"
   - Click "Save"

4. **Wait for Deployment**:
   - GitHub will automatically build and deploy your application
   - This may take 5-10 minutes for the first deployment

### **2. Access Your Live Application**

Once GitHub Pages is enabled and deployed, your application will be available at:

- **Main Application**: https://shayneismagic.github.io/APEX_GOEO_UTAH/
- **B2B Networking Hub**: https://shayneismagic.github.io/APEX_GOEO_UTAH/b2b_networking_hub.html

## üîß **What's Already Configured**

### **‚úÖ Build System**
- React application with TypeScript
- Material-UI components with Utah branding
- Production build optimization
- GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment

### **‚úÖ Deployment Files**
- `package.json` with correct homepage URL
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Build scripts and deployment configuration
- Public assets (favicon, logos, manifest)

### **‚úÖ Application Features**
- Advanced opportunity filtering system
- Kanban-style opportunity board
- Multiple view modes (Board, List, Table)
- B2B networking hub integration
- Sample data for testing

## üöÄ **Automatic Deployment**

Every time you push changes to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will:

1. **Build** the React application
2. **Copy** additional files (B2B hub HTML, logos)
3. **Deploy** to the `gh-pages` branch
4. **Update** your live application

## üì± **Testing Your Application**

### **Main Features to Test**:

1. **Opportunity Filtering**:
   - Use the left sidebar filters
   - Try quick filter presets (Hot Leads, Small Business, etc.)
   - Adjust match score and win probability ranges

2. **Opportunity Board**:
   - Switch between Board, List, and Table views
   - Click on opportunity cards for detailed views
   - Use bulk selection and actions

3. **B2B Networking Hub**:
   - Navigate to `/b2b_networking_hub.html`
   - Test search and filtering
   - View company profiles and government contacts

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### **If GitHub Pages Doesn't Work**:

1. **Check Repository Settings**:
   - Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled
   - Verify the source branch is set to `gh-pages`

2. **Check Actions Tab**:
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Look for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Check if it completed successfully

3. **Check gh-pages Branch**:
   - Look for a `gh-pages` branch in your repository
   - Ensure it contains the built application files

### **Common Issues**:

- **404 Errors**: Wait for deployment to complete (5-10 minutes)
- **Build Failures**: Check the Actions tab for error details
- **Missing Files**: Ensure all files are committed and pushed

## üîÑ **Making Updates**

To update your application:

1. **Make changes** to your code
2. **Commit and push** to the `main` branch
3. **GitHub Actions** will automatically deploy
4. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for the update to go live

## üìä **Performance & Optimization**

Your application includes:
- **Code splitting** for faster loading
- **Optimized bundles** with gzip compression
- **Service worker** for offline capabilities
- **Responsive design** for all devices

## üåê **Custom Domain (Optional)**

If you want to use a custom domain:

1. **Add CNAME file** to your repository
2. **Configure DNS** with your domain provider
3. **Update GitHub Pages settings** with your domain
4. **Wait for DNS propagation** (up to 24 hours)

## üìû **Support & Help**

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs** for build errors
2. **Review repository settings** for Pages configuration
3. **Check the gh-pages branch** for deployed files
4. **Verify file paths** in your application

## üéØ **Next Steps**

Once GitHub Pages is working:

1. **Test all features** thoroughly
2. **Share the live URL** with stakeholders
3. **Collect feedback** from users
4. **Plan next development phase** (backend, authentication, etc.)
