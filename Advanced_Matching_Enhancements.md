This comprehensive matching system goes far beyond basic NAICS and keyword matching to provide:

1. **Technical Capability Matching** - Technology stack, platform expertise, security requirements
2. **Past Performance Analysis** - Similar project experience, government contract history
3. **Geographic & Logistics** - Location proximity, travel capability, local presence
4. **Financial & Capacity** - Financial capacity, bonding, insurance, resource availability
5. **Team & Personnel** - Required skills, team size, key personnel experience
6. **Compliance & Regulatory** - Certifications, clearances, industry standards
7. **Machine Learning Enhancement** - Predictive win probability
8. **Market Intelligence** - Competition analysis, market conditions
9. **Continuous Optimization** - Feedback loops and weight optimization

This creates a truly comprehensive matching system that considers all the critical factors for successful government contracting, similar to what DevPipeline and other advanced systems provide.
